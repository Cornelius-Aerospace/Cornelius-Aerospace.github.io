Here at Cornelius Aerospace we come from humble origins. No rich daddy investments. Just the £10 in our pocket that we have to stretch to cover £50 of costs... luckly being an adult now (if 18 can be called such) we are able to work and fund our insane indevour. 

## What are we working on

This is a hard question to answer so early into our development of rockets and the technologies we need to achive our _somewhat_ ambitious goal of time above the karman line. In layman terms some of the work we will be doing includes:

1. Construction Methods
2. Flight computer optimisation (small, dainty and packed with **_DATA!_**).
3. Practising with weather balloons to explore the feasibility of a rocketoon or a similar system (because propellant is _EXPENSIVE_)
4. Experiment with various designs (boosters, staging, larger motors, praying and licking special crystals... all the norm really)
5. Optimising for altitude after other core features are refined, not much point getting to 10km and losing the £1000 rocket that got there.

## I got inspired by...

[Joe Barnard of BPS.space][1] and his fabulous [YouTube chanel][2] exploring so many innovative ideas and building up towards a spaceshot. [October Sky][3], a real life flim about a group of coal miner teens building model rockets - some of which went on to work at NASA and beyond. 
However most of all my biggest inspiration to do this was my first experience kaunching a model rocket with my dad, one of the few postive memories we have together and one i will never forget
<!-- (TODO add picture) -->
And many, many more...

This is all written from my perspective, Leah, I am the founder of Cornelius Aerospace and worked alone on many aspects of it (the rockets, flight computer and software/firmware) alone. Until oneday i showed my soon-to-be fiance a rocket launch. He was amazed by it (we 3D printed a small rocket which had to be ducktaped together and spiralled fantastically on launch before crash landing 10m in front of us) and a larger kit rocket that i adapted to be, in theory able to take more powerful motors.
<!-- (TODO add photo) -->

A few sucsessfull flights on A3 and B6 motors captivated him, until i decided to risk it (with the sunsetting behind us and our time, my time to show him the insane pleasure, exhilliration and sometimes sadness of a rocket flightr, unning out) and fitted a larger D9 motor.

There was an ignitor failure either due to:

1. my low power estes ignitor after so many flights going flat and failing to ignite the igniter (quite a sentance i know)
2. An issue with the ignitor causing it to slowly ignite as seen in the video we published on our youtube channel about casper
3. An issue with the motor, as crack, mosture, manufacture error etc that caused it to burn very slowly with little to no thrust and cook a hole in my launch pad (and set the entire plastic frame on fire)
4. Human error inerting the ignitor, connecting the ignitor leads or keeping it in place
5. The wind doing some crazy turbulance magic causing some quantum entanglement with a long burn motor firing in germany and then on inspection by our confused minds returning out of superposition (yes i know nothing about those topics and am waffling)
6. The gods disliking my tshirt and choosing for it to fail

In short, it is very hard to pin down the exact issue that caused casper to improperly ignite and melt my launch gear, but the most probable (and easiest to address for the future) was number 1 - meaning i set off to build my own, more reliable and CNet enabled (watch out for a post on CNet soon, join our mailing list!).

Regardless of the cause the motor retainer, made from high temperature something (all i could gather from estes, probably phelolic infused plastic) was essentially blow torched for 4 secconds and as such could not with stand the motor ejection charge when it set off. Instead of deploying the parachute the empty motor casing was fired out the back of the motor, speeding up caspers balistic projectory towards the rock hard dirt.

We did recover casper, looking sad, crumpled and very scorched. Sadly with no further flights in it, but i did recover the small plastic parachute from it and may use it as a predrouge for some multistage rocket.

Luckly this captivated seth enough he enthusiastically agreed to join the team turning my one-womman project into a real, colabarative mission. See our meet the team page to understand each of our roles and a writing on what we enjoy about rocketry enough to give up free time and ridiculous sums of money (our pateron remains rather dry, if a rich, rocket intrested person is reading this. You even get to name a rocket over a certain amount and get free merch).

Regardless we walked home not sad but motivated that night after learning an important lesson and following our motto:

> Push the rocket till it breaks and learn why it did; Make a rocket without that flaw and do the same.


#### Since then, lets send it!

Yours sincerelly, Leah Cornelius and all the team at Cornelius Aerospace
